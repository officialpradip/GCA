'''
You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of 
an edge. Write a program that takes the length of an edge(an integer) 
as input and prints the cube's surface area as output.
'''
length = int(input("Enter length of an edge"))
result= 6 * (length * length)
print(f"Cube's surface area is {result}")
